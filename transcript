    I am Deoshia, an eighteen year old female who have recently graduated William B. Murrah High School with a 4.1 GPA, and anticipate becoming a D.M. or D.V.M. I love to play the bassoon and to learn extraordinary facts involving natural and biological science. In 11th grade, I won an Eudora Welty Scholastic prize of a silver key for my poem. I have been employed at three different employers and volunteered at an animal shelter in the Jackson-metro area, always giving 150% no matter what chaos came my way. In 10th grade, I volunteered to work at Dillard’s during their one day Christmas sale. I was in charge of keeping my section of shoes organized. In 10th and 11th grade, I worked as a page for the Mississippi’s House of Representatives, running errands for the reps while they were busy in session. In 12th grade, I worked at the Jackson-Hinds Library System. There, I worked as a shelver, cashier, circulation assistant, and computer assistant. Also while a senior in high school, I volunteered at the animal shelter, cleaning the cages of cats and dogs, walking dogs, feeding them, etc.
I am excellent at hiding my impatience, needless to say I appear to be very patient. I love lending a helping hand to anything in need of my help, and I also love to lead and give ethical orders although others do not see me as leadership material. I work well in settings that does not have a constant routine, adjusting easily to new situations. (Adding your skills would help this paragraph) (Providing examples about you “lending a helping hand” and “adjusting easily to new situations”)
