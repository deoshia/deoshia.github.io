Hello. My name is Alexandria Kessee, a recent spring 2016 high school graduate from Murrah High School. I graduated with honors, received Special Honors for every term throughout the 2015-2016 school year, and served as a member of the National Honor Society. I served as the Junior Class Vice President for the 2014-2015 school year. I will be attending Tougaloo College as a Presidential Scholar in the fall of 2016 majoring Biology Pre-Med. I am a strong believer in God, and live by the scripture Philippians 3:14, “I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me.”
